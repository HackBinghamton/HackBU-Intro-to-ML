# Improving on our Previous Algorithms with our First Neural Network
We were able to achieve a respectable accuracy on scikit-learn's digits dataset using logistic regression. However, the dataset qas quite small and simple - each image was only 8 pixels by 8 pixels. Many monitors today support a resolution of at least 1920 pixels by 1080 pixels, so 8x8 is almost primitive compared to real-world data we'd be working with.

Take, for instance, the MNIST dataset, which contains 28 x 28 pixel handwritten digits for classification.
